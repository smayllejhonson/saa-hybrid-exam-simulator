# 🏗️ SAA Hybrid Exam Simulator

### 📜 The Manifesto
After five years of studying, practicing labs, and navigating life's hurdles, I am returning to the path to conquer the **AWS Solutions Architect Associate (SAA-C03)** exam. This project is my "re-entry" into the cloud, built on a fresh foundation.

### 🎯 The Mission
To master AWS architecture by building a full-stack **multiple-choice exam simulator**. This tool will mimic the SAA-C03 exam experience while running on a hybrid infrastructure—bridging the gap between my local "On-Prem" Linux lab and Cloud-Native AWS services.

### 🛠️ Technical Architecture (Tamriel)
* **Hardware:** Lenovo Laptop (Headless)
* **OS:** Ubuntu Server 24.04 LTS
* **Local Network:** 10.0.0.205 (Static IP)
* **Virtualization:** Docker Engine + Docker Compose
* **Security:** SSH-Key Only Access
